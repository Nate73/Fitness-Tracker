# Fitness-Tracker
A fitness tracker that stores the weight and reps of each set, storing the values in a CSV file. Adding my own spin on the coursework completed for the object oriented programming module by implementing the singletone software pattern and classes.

Features:
- Manages multiple athletes
- Search for last exercise of a muscles group
- Search for last set of a specific exercise
- Log an exercise
- Store exercise and athlete data in two seperate CSV files

Project Structure:
- main.java (Stores the java code for the project)
- athletes.csv (Stores athlete data, includes sample data)
- data.csv (Stores workout data, includes sample data)
